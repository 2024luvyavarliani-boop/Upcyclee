♻️ UpCycle Connect

UpCycle Connect is a web platform that helps students, labs, and departments share unused materials such as electronics, lab equipment, tools, scrap components, plastics, metal parts, etc — instead of throwing them away.

This supports sustainability, cost-saving, and circular reuse across campus 💚
