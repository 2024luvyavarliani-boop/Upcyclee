UpCycle Connect ♻

UpCycle Connect is a campus sustainability platform that enables students, laboratories, departments, and industry partners to share unused materials instead of discarding them.
The platform helps build a circular, reuse-first ecosystem where materials such as lab equipment, tools, components, scrap parts, and hardware can be listed, discovered, and reused.

Problem Statement

Across campuses and small industries, large volumes of usable materials are discarded due to lack of visibility and coordination. Students, labs, and innovators who could reuse these resources often have no way to discover them. This leads to unnecessary waste, higher procurement costs, and environmental impact.

Solution

UpCycle Connect provides a digital platform that:

• Allows users to list unused materials
• Makes materials searchable and discoverable
• Enables transparent request and reuse workflows
• Builds a resource-sharing community
• Reduces waste and landfill contribution ♻
